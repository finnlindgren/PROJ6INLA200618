# PROJ6INLA200618

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of PROJ6INLA200618 is to provide an easy workaround for a bug affecting
`INLA::inla.crs_set_lengthunit` in INLA version 20.06.18,
by overriding the relevant functions with corrected versions.

## Installation

You can install the package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("finnlindgren/PROJ6INLA200618")
```
## Example

Use the package like this:

```{r example}
library(INLA)
library(PROJ6INLA200618)
```
This will display a note about which functions are overridden.
